# Tempo
It's a smart scheduling app that combines to-do-list, schedular and event calender to help you organize your daily events whether with friends or as an individual more effectively and efficiently.

Expected Features:                                                                                                                         
   Calendar: It is a calendar that user can see weekly activities that can be permanent (repeated every weak) or temporary (just for one time). It is also possible that user can see other peoples' (who will be seen can be selected in settings) not available time but it is not possible to see what they are doing specifically due to privacy. In addition, user can use some sticker to label the activity in a better way.
   
   To-do-list: It is a check list that user can add tasks that should be done in that day. If a task is done, user can mark it as completed. Since they have no specific time period, they are not shown in the calendar.
  
  Smart feautures: The core idea of the system is that user can arrange a meeting easliy with that feature. Since user can see others free times, it is easy to select a time period and invite other people. After arrangement, the event will be added every user's calendar.
